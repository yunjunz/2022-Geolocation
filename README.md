# offset4slow_motion

Measure slow tectonic deformation from the stack of azimuth dense offsets

## To do list

1. Try a co-seismic or co-eruptive deformation interferogram.

2. Update theoretical calculation of offset velocity for ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1. Demonstrate the need of CUDA code to support large memory usage, i.e. a window size of 1024 by 1024.
