<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for ALOS sensor. The reference and secondary catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.

    Note 1: FBS/FBD
    ================

     ISCE also allows for processing of interferograms between FBD and FBS acquisitions.

     To process an FBD acquisition as an FBS one (FBD2FBS), you will need to include the following property
     <property name="RESAMPLE_FLAG">
        <value>dual2single</value>
    </property>


    ISCE also supports FBS2FBD operation. However, this is not recommended.
    <property name="RESAMPLE_FLAG">
        <value>single2dual</value>
    </property>

    Note 2: Multiple frames
    ========================

    ISCE can automatically stitch multiple raw data frames before focusing them. Modify your image file and leader file entries should be provided as lists as follows:

    <property name="IMAGEFILE">
        <value>['data/IMG-HH-1-H1.0__A','data/IMG-HH-2-H1.0__A']</value>
    </property>
    <property name="LEADERFILE">
        <value>['data/LED-1-H1.0__A','data/LED-2-H1.0__A']</value>
    </property>

    The entries for image file and leader file should match up, i.e, entry 1 in imagefile list should correspond to entry 1 in leaderfile list.

    Note 3 : Doppler Centroid
    ==========================

    ALOS raw data leaders do not include any doppler centroid information. These are always estimated from the data and lie between -0.5 and 0.5 PRF.
